# Planets
This is a toy repository for learning how to collaborate in GitHub.

## What to do?
1. Take a look at the issues and choose one you'd like to fix.
2. Fork this repo (see below).
3. Edit your own copy to solve your chosen issue.
4. Send me a pull request.

## What is a fork?
In GitHub jargon, to _fork_ means to create your own copy of someone else's repository.
After that, you can work in your own copy.
When you are done, you can request the owner of the original code to incorporate your changes.
The latter is known as _pull request_.
If the pull request is accepted, the edited code will be _merged_ into the original codebase.

Graphically:

Fork --> Edit --> PR["Pull request"] --if accepted--> Merge
```

The **fork, edit, pull request cycle**, is the usual way of collaborating in open software projects.
It can be tricky sometimes, mostly because multiple versions of the code will be evolving independently.
